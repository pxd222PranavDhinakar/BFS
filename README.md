# Graph Animation with Breadth-First Search

This project is a graph animation that demonstrates the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm using p5.js. It allows you to generate a random graph, run BFS, and step through the algorithm to visualize how it explores nodes.

## Getting Started

To launch the animation, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Open the `BFS.html` file in a web browser. This file contains the HTML and JavaScript code for the animation.

4. Interact with the animation using the provided buttons:
   - "Generate Graph": Creates a random graph.
   - "Run BFS": Initiates the BFS algorithm.
   - "Step BFS": Steps through the BFS algorithm one node at a time.

## Usage

- Adjust the number of nodes and edges using the input fields and click "Generate Graph" to create a random graph.

- Click "Run BFS" to start the BFS algorithm. Nodes will be colored to indicate their state (unexplored, currently exploring, explored).

- Use the "Step BFS" button to visualize the BFS algorithm step by step.

## Customization

You can modify the appearance and behavior of the animation by editing the following files:

- `sketch.js`: Contains the p5.js sketch code, including graph generation and BFS implementation.

- `bfs.js`: Contains functions related to running BFS.
